#This chapter covers the various built-in operators, which Python has to offer.

"""What Are Operators in Python?
Operators in Python are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on data (operands). They enable developers to manipulate  
variables and values to perform tasks like arithmetic calculations, comparisons, logical operations, and more.
Operators are an essential part of any programming language, as they provide the functionality needed to process data
and implement logic."""

"""Why Are Operators in Python?
Operators exist in Python for the following reasons:

1.Ease of Expression:
Operators simplify expressions and make code concise. For example, a + b is more intuitive and readable 
than a method call like add(a, b).

2.Mathematical and Logical Operations:
Operators provide tools to perform mathematical calculations (+, -, *, /) and logical operations (and, or, not) easily.

3.Comparison and Decision-Making:
Operators like ==, <, and > are essential for comparing values and implementing decision-making logic (e.g., in if statements).

4.Code Readability:
Operators make the code more human-readable. For example, x += 5 is easier to understand than x = x + 5.

5.Versatility:
Operators in Python support advanced functionalities like overloading, allowing developers to define custom behaviors for 
operators on user-defined objects.

6.Abstraction:
Operators abstract complex functionalities (e.g., + internally calls __add__() for objects).
This abstraction hides implementation details and focuses on high-level logic.

#Types of Operators in Python
"""
1.Arithmetic Operators: Used for basic mathematical operations.

+   Addition          a + b
-   Subtraction       a - b
*   Multiplication    a * b
/   Division          a / b
%   Modulus           a % b
**  Exponentiation    a ** b
//  Floor Division    a // b

2.Comparison (Relational) Operators: Used to compare two values and return a Boolean result.

==   Equal to         a == b
!=   Not equal        a != b
>    Greater than     a > b
<    Less than        a < b
>=   Greater or equal a >= b
<=   Less or equal    a <= b

3.Logical Operators: Combine multiple conditions.

and   Logical AND     a and b
or    Logical OR      a or b
not   Logical NOT     not a

4.Bitwise Operators: Perform operations at the bit level.

&   Bitwise AND       a & b
|   Bitwise OR        a | b
^   Bitwise XOR       a ^ b
~   Bitwise NOT       ~a
<<  Left Shift        a << b
>>  Right Shift       a >> b

5.Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables.

=   Assign            a = b
+=  Add and assign    a += b
-=  Subtract and assign a -= b
*=  Multiply and assign a *= b
/=  Divide and assign a /= b

6.Membership Operators: Check for membership in sequences.

in      Is in          a in b
not in  Is not in      a not in b

7.Identity Operators: Check object identity (memory location).

is      Same object    a is b
is not  Not same       a is not b

8.Ternary Operator: Conditional expressions.

value_if_true if condition else value_if_false

Why Are Operators Important?

1.Foundational for Programming:
They allow developers to write the core logic of programs, from simple calculations to complex decision-making.

2.Simplifies Code:
Instead of verbose function calls, operators provide syntactic sugar for various operations.

3.Flexibility:
Operators like in, is, and bitwise operators allow Python to support a wide range of applications, 
including data manipulation, logical reasoning, and low-level programming.

4.Customizability:
Python's operator overloading feature allows developers to define custom behavior for operators on their objects.

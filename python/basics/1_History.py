'''If we are talking about ABC in python context then it means that the programming language 'ABC' is reffered which was a general
 purpose programming language developed in nethierlands,amsterdam
at the CWI(Centrum Wiskunde and Informatica) the gratest achievement of the ABC was to influence the design of python.
 python waas conceptualized in late 1980's when 
 guido van rossum was working on a project at CWI9Centrum wiskunde and Informatica) called amoeba which was a distributed OS.'''

'''The first realeased  version of python code was 0.9.0 at alt.sources on feburary 1991 '''
'''This version already included exception halding,functions and core data types of the list,dict,str , and others.'''

'''the python version 1.0 was released in janurary 1994 it included new features which were functional programming tools
 lamda,map,filter and reduce.'''

'''after 6.5 years on october 2000 python 2.0 was releaASED it included list comprehensions, a full garbage collector and
 it was supporting unicode.
(Unicode is a universal character encoding standard that is maintained by the Unicode Consortium)'''

'''python flourished for another 8 years in versions 2.x before the next major release of python 3.0(also known as 
python3000 and Py3K) python 3 is not backwards compatible with python 2.x'''

'''the emphasis on python 3 was on the removal of duplicate programming construct and modules coming close to fulfilling 
the 13th law of the Zen of Python: "There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it."'''

'''The Zen of Python
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those'''


'''Some changes in Python 3.0:
Print is now a function
Views and iterators instead of lists
The rules for ordering comparisons have been simplified. E.g. a heterogeneous list cannot be sorted,
 because all the elements of a list must be comparable to each other.
There is only one integer type left, i.e. int. long is int as well.
The division of two integers returns a float instead of an integer. "//" can be used to have the "old" behaviour.
Text Vs. Data Instead Of Unicode Vs. 8-bit'''
